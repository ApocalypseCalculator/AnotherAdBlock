Yet another Ad Block, made for efficiency and simplicity

It simply blocks all connections to the blacklisted domains, thus preventing nearly all trackers/ads from operating.

Additionally, for these sites, custom scripts are injected: 
- YouTube: attempts to force skip the ad/reduce ad duration
- Reddit: removes ads and unblocks NSFW posts
- Google, Google Maps, Amazon: removes the ads/promoted listings
- Wikipedia: block donation prompts

Updated to Manifest V3
