Yet another Ad Block, made for efficiency and simplicity

It simply blocks all connections to the blacklisted domains, thus preventing nearly all trackers/ads from operating.

Additionally, for these sites, custom scripts are injected: 
- YouTube: attempts to force skip the ad/reduce ad duration
- Google: removes the ads/promoted listings
- Reddit: removes ads and unblocks NSFW posts


## Installation Guide

Refer to [here](https://github.com/ApocalypseCalculator/AnotherAdBlock/blob/main/install.md) for the installation guide

## Why is this better than AdBlock Plus?

- Minimization. The entire zipped extension folder is less than 50kb. 
- High accuracy. Tested to have an accuracy of 99%+ in normal browsing circumstances. 
- No latency. Huge boost in website loading speeds and unnoticable background processing.  

## Coming Soon

- Graphical interactions
- Toggling on/off
- Manually including custom domains
- Allowing direct access
