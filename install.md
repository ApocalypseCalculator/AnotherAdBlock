# Installation Guide

First of all, download the latest release from the [Releases tab](https://github.com/ApocalypseCalculator/AnotherAdBlock/releases)

After unzipping the folder to a convenient location, open your browser and go to your extensions page (chrome://extensions for Chrome, edge://extensions for Edge, and so on). 

On the top right corner, toggle the "Developer Mode" to on.

Find the **load unpacked** button and select the unzipped folder of AnotherAdBlock. 

If you see the icon with an "ON" banner, it is ready for use!
